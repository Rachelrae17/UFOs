# UFOs

Module 11 JavaScript 

Overview of Project:
The Purpose of this prodject was to dive deep into using Javascript and be able to develop the web skills need to demonstrate to show the data  of the UFOs from the sighting in 2010. The Filterable table is used from the website and being able to include different inputs to then filter information that has been gather to then be put into rows. With using Javascript the resources that were incorperated into this project was using index.html and app.js and Nasa Images to help build the webpage demonstration.

Results:
Dana would be able to walk through this website by being able to understand the images and the datatables that were created by the diffrerent input users. 
The first table is displayed with A Backround data that is filter for a user to then use as an input display.

Then the second table shows a filter table with now two diferent inputs that have been enter by the user, Dana should be able to grasp that data from viewing the image.

Summary: 
From doing this analyst project the two main drawbacks were first I thought it was difficult to scrape the website and use javascript coding to first gather the information 
in which I needed to show on my filtertable. Second drawback that I found difficult was creating the tables, and making a visual discription, however I see why it is valuable for the user to have a filtertable because an image can show more than then just a paragraph so I see why it was necessary to take those actions for this analysts. 
My first recomendation for this development is to make sure you understand the key development points on javascript so you are able to identify what image you want to create. 
Then my second recomendation would be able to have more text boxs that you could enter in more than city,state, country, Shape exc. I know for this specific project that key 
information was needed to be inculded but I also recommended  that you could have a wider table to then be able to input more data if needed.
